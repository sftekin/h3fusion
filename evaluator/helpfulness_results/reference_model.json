One team is designated as the \"kickers\" and the other team is designated as the \"fielders.\" The game is played on a large diamond-shaped field, with a home plate at one end, and a pitcher's mound at the other.\n\nThe object of the game is to score more runs than the other team. A runner advances around the bases by hitting a ball that has been pitched by the opposing team, and then running to the next base. If the ball is caught by a fielder before it touches the ground, the runner is out. If the runner is hit by a ball while running, he is out.\n\nThe game is divided into innings, and each team bats until three players are out. The team that is kicking then takes the field, and the other team becomes the kicking team. The game is usually played for seven innings.",
